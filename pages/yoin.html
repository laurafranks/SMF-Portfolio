				<p>The word &quot;Yoin&quot; &#40;yoh-EEN&#41; is a Japanese word for which there is no direct English translation&#46; In his book &quot;They Have A Word for it&#58; A Lighthearted Lexicon of Untranslatable Words &amp; Phrases&quot;&#44;
				Rheingold &#40;1988&#44; p 142&#41; describes it as &quot;Experiential reverberation that continues to move you long after the initial external stimulus has ceased&#46;&quot; 
				Rheingold then goes on to suggest that the &quot;Bell&quot; refers to human feeling&#46; In her book &quot;What Our Stories Teach Us&#58; A Guide to Critical Reflection for College Faculty&quot;&#44; Linda K&#46; Shadiow &#40;2013&#41;&#44; 
				uses this word to express thanks to those that helped her with her book&#46; 
				</p>
				<p>I would go further&#44; tying the word directly to the act of teaching&#46; We do not look to make short term changes in the lives of our students&#46; We seek to enact Yoin upon our students.&#46;
				</p>
				<p>Keeping with the Japanese aesthetic of the word &quot;Yoin&quot;&#44; I have included in my teaching philosophy artifact&#44; two items&#58; one&#44; a sketch of the Japanese ceremonial Goh Ohn bell that can be found at Ontario Place&#44; 
				designed by architect Raymond Moriyama&#44; this bell and its creator well meet the term Yoin&#59; two&#44; a Haiku&#44; written in a more classic Japanese style&#46;
				</p>
				<p>This Haiku&#44; designed to express with the fewest syllables possible&#44; &#40;though that is harder in English&#44; where our syllables tend to differ in length&#44; then in Japanese&#44; where an &quot;on&quot; is always the same length&#41; 
				meets the Haiku structure and style&#44; by having two line separated by one that is juxtaposed&#44; &#40;<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Haiku-Poem#Choose_a_Haiku_Subject" target="_blank">www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Haiku-Poem#Choose_a_Haiku_Subject</a>&#41;&#44; and expresses my philosophy&#46;
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>That we must teach knowing that we are changing lives&#46;</li>
					<li>That we must construct curriculum that aims at the long term goals of the learner&#46;</li>
					<li>That&#44; knowing that we affect our students lives&#44; we must &#40;and therefore are empowered to&#41; sometimes make hard decisions&#44; like failing a student if it is in his&#47;her best interest&#46;</li>
					<li>That we are here to guide and direct&#46; The students have the ability to grow&#44; we just have to show them the way&#46;</li>
					<li>That&#44; following Pratt&#39;s perspective&#44; our students are our apprentices&#46; &quot;An Apprenticeship Perspective&#58; modeling ways of being&quot; &#40;Pratt 1998&#41;</li>
				</ol>
				<p>This final point&#44; that our students are our apprentices&#44; is one that I can truly see, being once myself an apprentice mechanic&#44; and the apprentice Ferrier &#40;blacksmith&#41;&#46; 
				I understood well my role as apprentice&#44; as this was necessary for me&#44; to not only learn, but to fit into the community for which I was preparing&#46; It took me many years however&#44; having my bell rung many time so to speak&#44; 
				to come to understand the role of Master&#46;
				</p>
				<p>Master&#44; not a cool word these days&#44; fallen out of favor&#44; and one that is open to misinterpretation or misuse&#46; In my mind&#44; it was never Master over the Apprentice&#44; but Master of the craft&#44; one to look up to&#44; to emulate&#46;
				</p>
				<p>Taking the TPI &#40;Teaching Perspective Inventory&#41; I can see&#44; examining my answers to Pratt&#39;s questions&#44; I do indeed fall under the &quot;Apprenticeship&quot; perspective&#44; though like everyone&#44; I exhibit parts of all perspectives&#46;

				<aside style="margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:-0.5em;">&quot;Good teachers are highly skilled practitioners of what they teach&#46; Whether in classrooms or at work sites&#44; they are recognized for their expertise&#46; Teachers must reveal the inner workings of skilled performance and must translate it into 
				accessible language and an ordered set of tasks which usually proceed from simple to complex&#44; allowing for different points of entry depending upon the learner&#39;s capability&#46; Good teachers know what their learners can do on their own and where they 
				need guidance and direction&#59; they engage learners within their &#39;zone of development&#39;&#46; As learners mature and become more competent&#44; the teacher&#39;s role changes&#59; they offer less direction and give more responsibility as students progress from dependent 
				learners to independent workers&#46;&quot;
				</aside>
				<p>This descriptive narrative from Pratt&#44; which summarizes the Apprenticeship perspective&#44; resonates with me as being true&#44; and as something I have always tried to follow&#44; even though I had never read this perspective until now&#46;
				</p>
				<p>In context then&#44; I can see that my role as a teacher is to guide&#44; to exemplify the professional in the field&#44; to ensure that content is delivered in a way that allows the learner to discover and grow&#44; and to give guidance in that growth&#46;
				</p>
				<p>To evidence this in my own teaching style&#44; I only have at look to where my office is&#46;
				</p>
				<p>When I first started at Durham College&#44; I was offered an office in a new build out on the third floor&#44; sharing an office with another Professor in the School of Business&#46; Instead I fought to have a smaller&#44; older office&#44; shared with 4 
				others from different schools&#44; that happens to be directly in sight of&#44; and in fact has windows into&#44; both my main labs&#46; When asked why I wanted a smaller&#44; older office with old furniture&#44; instead of a nice new office with new furniture&#44; 
				I simply stated &quot;I want to be there for my students&#46;&quot; I do not believe we can guide or be a model in absentia&#46;
				</p>
				<p>&quot;Teachers must reveal the inner workings of skilled performance and must translate it into accessible language&#46;&#46;&#46;&quot;
				</p>
				<p>This fall&#44; a 3rd year student received a failing mark in one of my classes&#44; 47&#37;&#46; The student contacted me&#44; knowing&#44; I think&#44; that he would have to face me in a class this winter&#44; and asked me if there was anything he could do&#46; 
				I went over his marks with him&#44; and summarized for him why he failed&#46; &quot;Aside from your marks&#44; I am concerned that you are missing some of the skills you will need to be successful&#46; This is not a matter of doing an extra lab&#44; or re&#45;writing a test&#44; 
				but of learning what you need&#44; and being able to express it&quot; The student will be doing a makeup class this spring&#46;
				</p>
				<p>&quot;As learners mature and become more competent&#44; the teacher&#39;s role changes&#59; they offer less direction and give more responsibility as students progress from dependent learners to independent workers&#46;&quot;
				</p>
				<p>Back a number of years ago at another college I had a student that was failing in a number of classes&#46; When talking to the student&#44; I happen to use car parts as an example &#40;it was a data base class&#41;&#46; The student just lit up&#46; Talking about cars&#44; 
				he was more animated than I had ever seen him&#46; When asked &quot;Why did you get into computers when you love cars&#63:&quot; he replied that &quot;everyone said you could get a better job in computers&#46;&quot;
				</p>
				<p>I took the student to the Coordinator for the automotive school&#44; and helped him transfer&#46; He had been in 2nd year of a 3 year program&#44; and had to basically start over&#46; When asked by my chair&#44; &quot;couldn&#39;t you keep him in our school&#63;&quot; 
				My response was&#44; &quot;I did what was best for the student&quot;&#46;  He graduated one of the top of his class a few years later&#46;
				</p>
				<p>&quot;Good teachers know what their learners can do on their own and where they need guidance and direction&#63; they engage learners within their &#39;zone of development&#39;&#46;&quot;
				</p>
				<p>In development of curriculum&#44; I have often been the lead in pushing to advance the material to keep it current&#44; and to push the students&#44; to get more out of them&#44; and stretch them&#46; On more than one occasion this has pushed the material out of the 
				comfort zones of both myself and my colleagues&#46;  When this happens&#44; I remind my colleagues&#44; and myself&#44; that we are in an industry that demands change &#40;computer science&#41; and that we must grow to meet the needs of our students&#46; 
				It was with this in mind that a few years ago I started and finished my Masters in computer science&#44; after not being a student for over 15 years&#46;
				</p>
				<p>&quot;Good teachers are highly skilled practitioners of what they teach&#46;&#46;&#46;&quot;
				</p>
				<p>I believe&#44; that with proper introspection&#44; one can have a one word philosophy in teaching&#46;  That it matches well with Pratt&#39;s Apprenticeship Perspective &#40;and aligns well with many of his other perspectives&#41; and can help guide me to be a better teaching practitioner&#46;
