					<h1 style="font-size:1.2em;color:bisque;">The School of Life</h1>
					<p>To begin this story&#44; you should understand that at the end of high school&#44; I was not ready to continue my formal education&#46; I wanted to &quot;live&quot;&#44; 
					and have some &quot;real life experience&quot; &#40;as I saw it then&#41;&#44; and had no patience for an education that I felt was delivered too slowly&#44; 
					and in too repetitive a manner&#44;
					</p>
					<p>By the age of 20&#44; I managed a few gas stations&#44; and had approximately 30 people working for me&#46;  Got bored&#44; and switched to being a mechanic&#39;s apprentice&#46; 
					Got bored&#44; and switched to being the youngest provincial supervisor Burns Security ever had&#46; Got bored &#40;getting a theme here&#63;&#41; and became a farrier&#44; 
					then a dairy lab technician&#44; then started my career in IT &#40;I had been avoiding IT as it was my father&#39;s line of work&#41;&#46; I worked for a local computer company&#44; 
					went to college&#44; then started my own company&#46;
					</p>
					<p>I worked for the federal government&#44; contracted for the NRC &#40;National Research Council&#41;&#44; worked for IBM&#44; ExecuTrain &#40;training company&#41;&#44; Tridel &#40;condos&#41;&#44; 
					the Canadian Cancer Society&#44; and then&#44; finally&#44; Centennial then Durham Colleges&#46;
					</p>
					<p>A long string&#44; and selecting one or two&#44; and then one or two meaningful stories&#44; was at first a daunting task&#46; To help select&#44; I went through some stories in my head&#44; 
					and chose those that met two criteria&#46; 1&#46; That it be a story that I have retold and would likely retell again&#46; It must mean something to me then right&#63; 
					2&#46; It must mark for me a vector change&#46;
					</p>
					<p>I use the term vector&#44; for those who are unfamiliar with the term&#44; by its mathematical or physics definition&#44;&quot; a quantity having direction as well as magnitude&#44; esp&#46; 
					as determining the position of one point in space relative to another&#46;&quot;  &#40;Google definition&#41;
					</p>
					<p>This means then&#44; that the story marks a point where I either changed direction&#44; or sped up or slowed down&#46; Either way&#44; it must mark a change in my life&#46;

					<h1 style="font-size:1.2em">College&#44; Mr&#46; High Score</h1>
					<aside>
					<p class="italic">I remember as a student how proud I was&#46; Looking back now&#44; as a professor myself&#44; I understand my prof&#39;s statement to me&#46; 
					I have to wonder if he ever had a conversation with Mr&#46; High Score&#46; Did he connect the students to the curriculum&#63; Did he motivate them&#63; Did he push enough7#44; 
					or was he just waiting to see what happened&#63; Was this a case of self-fulfilling prophecy&#44; grading inverse to pinball scores&#63; I don&#39;t think so&#46; 
					I would like to think that my prof communicated his concerns to the students&#46; In retrospect though&#44; he was known as being hard to approach&#46;
					</p>
					<p class="bold">I would not leave this to chance&#59; I would make sure Mr&#46; High Score knew why he was there&#46;
					</p>
					</aside>
					<p>After years of avoiding it&#44; doing many other things&#44; whole different careers&#44; let alone jobs&#44; I was finally ready to go to College&#46; 
					Holland College&#44; in Charlottetown P&#46;E&#46;I&#46; had a unique&#44; for the time&#44; outcome based curriculum that was everything I wanted&#46; 
					I could work&#44; for the most part&#44; at my own pace and could test out on items early&#46; Because of this I was able to complete 18 months of work in 6&#44; 
					and turn my Co-op into a contract&#44; and then a company&#46; 
					</p>
					<p>One day&#44; after testing out on some electronic AC theory&#44; I was walking with my instructor&#44; a gruff&#44; ex&#45;military man&#44; past the student lounge&#44; 
					where some of my cohort was playing pinball&#46; &quot;Who&#39;s got high score&#63;&quot; my prof called in&#46; &quot;I do&#33;&quot; called back one of the students&#44; happily&#46; 
					As we walked on&#44; the Prof quietly asked me my score on the game&#46; I had to admit that it was pretty low&#59; I did not have much time to play&#46; 
					My prof stopped and put a hand on my shoulder&#46; &quot;That&#39;s why you will graduate out of here early&#44; and Mr&#46; High Score back there has not done a test yet&#44; 
					he will likely not make it&#44; he does not know why he is here&#46;&quot;

					<h1 style="font-size:1.2em">A Masters Later In Life</h1>
					<aside>
					<p class="italic">This was a major factor in my success&#44; the scheduled routine&#46; In my first course at the university&#44; one that was not for credit&#44; but required&#44; 
					they emphasized this&#44; as did my Student Support Manager&#46; I resented it a bit at the time&#44; but now think that the repeated emphasis on &quot;schedule a regular time&quot; 
					was well thought out&#46; I understand that&#44; even at that level &#40;Masters&#41; they still felt that they needed to teach how to learn&#46;
					</p>
					<p class="bold">We have to teach the students more than just the subject&#44; we have to teach them how to learn&#46;
					</p>
					</aside>
					<p>Late in my life&#44; and much to my surprise more than 10 years after my last go at formal education&#44; I found myself enrolling in a Master&#39;s program&#46;  
					This was a surprise to me&#44; because if you had asked me a few years earlier&#44; I would say &quot;No&#44; I have no interest&quot; and &quot;All I need now I will 
					obtain through industry certifications&quot;&#46; I had no motivation to put myself through either the expense of more formal education&#44; or the work that it would 
					involve&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Things changed&#46; First&#44; the system &#40;college&#41; was starting to look for higher academic credentials&#44; and if I wished mobility in the system&#44; 
					I would have to do something&#46;  Second&#44; my wife&#44; Laura&#44; was interested in continuing her education&#44; and wanted me along for the ride&#46;
					</p>
					<p>This started me looking for a program that would interest&#44; challenge and advance both of us in our fields&#44; not just in education&#44; but in technology&#46; 
					We selected University of Liverpool in the U&#46;K7#46; for a few reasons&#46; One&#44; they had a masters in IT Security&#44; one of the first to have such&#46; 
					Second&#44; it ranked well worldwide&#44; and both Laura and I wanted an international education that would be well recognised&#46;
					</p>
					<p>We jumped in&#44; a year and a half in courses&#44; and nine months of dissertation&#46; Two to three hours every night in our study&#44; reading and writing&#44; 
					challenging each other to stretch and do better&#44; competing against ourselves&#46;
					</p>
					<aside style="margin-top:-1em">
					<p class="italic">In retrospect&#44; motivation was what got me through my Masters&#46; Having a goal&#44; and keeping my focus on it was the key to my success&#44; 
					more than any other single factor&#46;
					</p>
					<p class="bold">Keep motivating your students&#44; they might all have different reasons to be there&#44; but they all need a reason&#46;
					</p>
					</aside>
					<p>At times it was work&#44; and we would wonder why we were putting ourselves through it&#46; Then we would talk about graduation&#44; 
					about how this would lead us along the path to our goals&#44; and it wasn&#39;t quite so much work anymore&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Both Laura and I graduated with Distinction&#46; We were two of only four to do so&#44; out of a graduating class of nineteen&#46;  Many of our classmates fell 
					by the wayside&#46;

					<article>
					<h1 style="font-size:1.2em">The Federal Government&#44; Nice place to visit&#46;&#46;&#46;</h1>
					<aside>
					<p class="italic">I lived for the challenge and the chance to grow&#46; In reflection&#44; I now also realize that I revelled in the fact that I was trusted to solve my own problems&#44; 
					though I had support&#44; I was expected to do for myself first&#46;
					</p>
					<p class="italic">In teaching I seek to challenge my students&#46; They are at their best when they must rise to the challenge&#46; When I start a new lab&#44; I get them started&#44; then I leave the room for a while&#46; 
					I find when I do this&#44; all the little questions and problems are solved by the time I get back&#46;
					</p>
					<p class="bold">Give Students the time and the opportunity to solve their problems&#46;
					</p>
					</aside>
					<p>Working for ACOA&#44; the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency&#44; was at first my Co&#33;op placement in College&#44; and then my first contract job as a newly minted Computer Technician&#46;
					</p>
					<p>My first day&#44; walking in&#44; I was presented with a key to the server room&#44; admin passwords&#44; told &quot;good luck&quot; and then the team that installed the new facility left the 
					province to go set up another&#46; If you need us&#44; you can get hold of us&#44; I was told&#44; then&#44; but not for three weeks&#59; we&#39;ll all be out of contact till next month&#46;
					</p>
					<p>I lived in that server room for two weeks&#44; having pizza delivered&#44; and avoiding human contact as I learned as much as I could&#44; as quick as I could&#46; I did not call my support in 
					three weeks&#46; In fact&#44; two months in&#44; I contacted them to offer to help solve a problem that they had broadcast a need for assistance for&#44; which I had solved in those original three weeks&#46;
					</p>
					<p>I left ACOA after the system had been stable for over a year&#44; and I realized that I was spending most of my time on a tennis court with a pager on&#46; There was no more challenge&#44; 
					and little chance to grow&#46;

					<h1 style="font-size:1.2em">The Cancer Society Burned Out</h1>
					<aside>
					<p class="italic">For everyone&#44; there comes a point where it is too much&#46; In retrospect&#44; I wonder if my manager at the Society saw that I needed to stop&#46; If he reached out and 
					got me my job at Centennial&#63; I don&#39;t know&#44; but it is possible&#46; As much as one might love what they do&#44; if they are given too much&#44; they will respond&#46; The quality of their work&#44; 
					or their life&#44; may drop off&#46; Or they may opt to just stop&#44; or change&#46; We as faculty must always watch for the signs that a student is being over worked and should respond&#44; before they do&#46;
					</p>
					<p class="bold">If you see the quality of a students work drop&#44; or their attitude change for the worse in class&#44; question it&#33;
					</p>
					</aside>
					<p>I loved working for the Cancer Society&#46; I was proud to work for such an organization&#44; and with some of the best&#44; most dedicated people I had ever met&#46; As Network and Telecom Analyst&#44; 
					I looked after the Provincial office in Toronto&#44; 7 regional offices in Cancer Centres across Ontario&#44; and over 60 smaller offices spread across small towns in Ontario&#46; I worked with one other 
					IT person&#44; and before I left&#44; had hired a help desk support person&#46; When I left&#44; they hired &#40;within the year&#41; 3 people to replace me&#46;
					</p>
					<p>I was working 12 to 14 hours a day&#44; 6 to 7 days a week&#46; I loved the work&#44; there was always something to do&#44; always another project coming down the pipe&#44; always fires to put out&#46; 
					This met my need to be needed&#44; to be challenged&#44; and to grow&#46;
					</p>
					<p>But I was getting tired&#44; and I could see no sign of a break&#46; I had just finished a major Exchange &#40;email&#41; roll out&#44; and was informed that a new database and accounting project would 
					be starting&#46; They &quot;might&quot; be able to get me help &#40;they did get my helpdesk person&#41; but the workload would be steady for another 18 months&#46;
					</p>
					<p>At that time&#44; I was approached by Centennial to teach&#46; The dean and chair came to my office at the Society&#46; I don&#39;t even know how they found me&#44; but they asked for me by name&#44; 
					and made an offer&#44; and it included summers off&#33;
					</p>
					<p>I was exhausted&#46; I had not had a vacation in years&#44; and&#44; if I stayed&#44; I would have to commit to the end of the next project&#46; I could not start and not finish&#46; I loved the job&#44; 
					loved the people&#44; but for everyone&#44; there comes a point where it is too much&#46;
