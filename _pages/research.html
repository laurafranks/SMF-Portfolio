					<h1 style="font-size:1.2em;color:bisque;">Authentic Testing in Technical Programs &#45; Retention Increase semesters Two to Three</h1>
					<h2>1&#46;	Introduction&#47;Background&#58;</h2>
					<p>Historically&#44; the highest attrition rate for students in the Computer Systems Technician&#44; Technology programs at Durham College has been between second and third semester&#46; 
					This attrition level is three to four times higher than between any other semester pair&#46;
					</p>
					<p>There is a growing prevalence of authentic assessment in education&#44; and with current studies in UDL and authentic testing showing that authentic teaching and assessment &quot;connects&quot; 
					the students to the curriculum&#44; I postulate that with the adoption of authentic assessment we will lessen the attrition rates in our courses between these semesters&#46;
					</p>
					<p>In order to establish whether or not a move to authentic testing has been successful in lowering attrition&#44; a study of &quot;traditional&quot; historic courses must first be conducted&#46; 
					A relationship or correlation must be drawn between marks or success in these courses and retention&#46;
					</p>
					<p>To limit variables in this study&#44; I will limit the courses investigated to DCOM 1100 and DCOM 2100&#44; first and second semester courses that are taught using industry standardised and 
					provided curriculum and standard testing&#44; primarily true false and multiple choice&#44; as well as hands on finals&#46; Six sections of these courses are taught each term&#46; 
					This curriculum is standardized across sections&#47;terms&#47;years and a long track record for these courses is available&#46;
					</p>
					<p>I propose that a ratio be developed that ties marks to attrition for these courses&#46; Once historic correlations have been established&#44; three of the six course blocks will be taught using 
					only authentic assessment&#44; the remaining three course blocks will retain traditional test&#46; Students will be followed from semester one through three&#44; and comparisons will then be made to 
					determine if there is a significant statistical change in retention between the three section blocks in each testing approach&#44; and against historical retention&#47;attrition levels&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Success will be determined by a significant change in attrition&#46;
					</p>
					<h2>2&#46;	Literature Review&#58;</h2>
					<p>As individual items&#44; that is items addressing retention and addressing authentic assessment&#44; there has been much published work&#46; That said&#44; there has been little work done that 
					connects directly these two areas&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Examining existing literature&#59; I have selected seven different items&#44; and categorized them into three groups&#59;
					</p>
					<h3>Items specific to retention&#46;</h3>
					<ol>

						http://www.collegesontario.org/outcomes/accountability/CO_MEASURING_GRADUATION.pdf</a></li>
						<li>Drea&#44; C&#46; &#40;2014&#41;&#46; Student Attrition And Retention In Ontario&#39;s Colleges&#46; Retrieved from College Quarterly&#58; <a href="http://www.collegequarterly.ca/2004-vol07-num02-spring/drea.html" target="_blank">
						http://www.collegequarterly.ca/2004-vol07-num02-spring/drea.html</a></li>
					</ol>
					<p>Within these items&#44; Cuseo helps paint a picture of those items that effect retention&#46; In his work&#44; he divides issues that affect attrition into 4 groups&#44; Academic&#44; Motivational&#44; Psychosocial and Financial&#46; 
					He further defines Academic to include an aspect of disinterest and within Motivational&#44; he lists perceived irrelevance&#46; These are the two areas where I will attempt to&#44; 
					via my literature review&#44; tie Authentic testing to retention&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Donner and Drea both introduce outside environmental factors to attrition&#44; and also provide context for our numbers&#44; placing them within Ontario as a whole&#46; They also will help tie KPI results to this 
					studies results&#44; giving us further statistics to assess&#46;
					</p>
					<h3>Items specific to authentic assessment</h3>

						<li>Saulnie&#44; B&#46; L&#46; &#40;2008&#41;&#46; From Teaching to Learning&#58; Learner&#45;Centered Teaching and Assessment</li>
					</ol>
					<p>These items will assist in defining authentic assessment&#44; and will be used to ensure that those course assessments changed qualify as authentic&#44; and are graded in a manner that follows adopted best practices&#46;
					</p>
					<h3>Items that bridge both Retention and Authentic Assessment&#46;</h3>
					<ol start="6">

						</li>

					</ol>
					<p>It is in the third group that I will spend most of my time&#44; though the first two groups help define the area of research&#44; providing terms and context&#44; these items will assist in validating results and will be used as 
					benchmarks for success&#46;
					</p>
					<p>In particular&#44; Wiggins makes the statement&#44; &quot;A move toward more authentic tasks and outcomes thus improves teaching and learning&#58; students have greater clarity about their obligations &#40;and are asked to master more 
					engaging tasks&#41;&#44; and teachers can come to believe that assessment results are both meaningful and useful for improving instruction&#46;&quot; &#40;Wiggins&#44; 1990&#41; Relating the statement that students would have a better 
					clarity about their obligations would work well with Cuseo&#39;s academic and motivational statements&#46; &#40;Cuseo&#44; 2007&#41;
					</p>
					<p>In all&#44; though there are many papers and some studies&#44; I have&#44; to date&#44; found little information that directly ties Authentic Assessment to Retention&#44; and none that examines these items in my specific area of 
					teaching&#46;
					</p>
					<h2>3&#46; Research Questions&#58;</h2>
					<p>What is the effect on retention of moving to authentic assessment within technical courses&#63; For the purpose of this study&#44; &quot;effect&quot; will be gauged on two questions&#49;
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Is there a change in grades using authentic assessment vs&#46; traditional testing&#63;</li>
						<li>Is there a change to retention when using authentic assessment vs&#46; traditional testing&#63;</li>
					</ol>
					<h2>4&#46; Research Design&#58;</h2>
					<p>Research Methodology&#58; The type of research to be carried out for this project is a quantitative in nature&#44; I will be attempting to remove subjective data and opinions&#44; and focus on the numbers&#46; 
					Results will be based on statistical relevance&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Research Approach&#58; Research will take place in four ways&#59;
					</p>
					<p>First&#44; A literature review will be conducted with the intent of refining terms and definitions and to frame the question&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Second&#44; historical research will be conducted on the selected courses&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Third&#44; courses will be delivered using the traditional test methods&#44; and authentic assessment&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Fourth&#44; follow&#45;up studies will be undertaken to gather relevant statistics on both groups&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Participants&#58; Students will be primarily used in this study&#46; Faculty will be utilized to deliver the material&#44; but will not be involved &#47; informed about the focus&#47;goals of the study until 
					after completion&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Ethical Considerations&#58; No changes to learning outcomes will be made to the courses&#46; Students who are in the Authentic Assessment group will be given the option to write standardized testing and utilize 
					that mark should they feel that there is a discrepancy in markings &#47; marks achieved in other sections&#46; Assistance will be provided to faculty to ensure that no work load issues occur&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Ethical approval from the College Research Ethics board&#44; as per policy ADMIN&#45;231&#44; Procedure 231&#46;1 will be sought&#46; By the procedures definition&#44; &quot;Human participants are individuals 
					whose data or responses to interventions&#44; stimuli or questions by the researcher are relevant to answering the research question&quot; &#40;Durham College Procedure 231&#46;1&#41; That stated&#44; I believe 
					that this project would be accepted as minimal risk&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Data Collection&#58; Data will be collected via the Office of Institutional Research&#46; No names or student numbers will be used&#44; tracking numbers will be generated&#46; These numbers will be abstracted 
					and used for the purpose of following the students&#39; progression only&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Data Analysis&#58; Data analysis will take the form of a statistical analysis of grades and of attrition&#46;  Grades from other courses&#44; both in the previous courses and in courses taken concurrently with 
					the study courses will be factored into the statistics&#46;
					</p>
					<h2>5&#46; Significance and Contribution to the Field&#58;</h2>
					<p>It is my hope that showing that there is a correlation between the adoption of Authentic Assessment within my area of specialization&#44; Computer Science&#44; that I can do the following&#59;
					</p>
					<p>Gain buy&#45;in from faculty that are traditionally mired in &quot;old style&quot; testing&#44; and continually argue for a link between traditional testing and industry certification passing&#44; rather than 
					passing the program and getting a job&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Gain buy&#47;in from administration&#44; so that the costs of development&#44; both pedagogy and professor&#44; will be better received&#46;
					</p>
					<p>Increase the opportunities for in&#45;house training and faculty development&#46;
					</p>
					<p>It is my hope to provide students with more real world connection to the subjects they are learning&#44; to increase retention&#44; and to promote student success&#46;
