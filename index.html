				<p>Stephen Franks is a 14 year veteran of the college system.  During his time as a college professor Stephen has used his experience in the Information Technology industry to encourage and excite his students&#46;
				He skilfully combines the <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/" target="_blank">Universal Design for Learning</a> principles with authentic situations in his classes so his students graduate with the confidence to walk into a job and perform to the high expectations of today&#39;s employers&#46;
				</p>
				<p>As evident as Stephen&#39;s passion is for the industry he works in &#40;he has had many careers&#44; none of them lasted as long as his teaching career has&#41; his passion for his students and their learning experience is even stronger&#46;
				Stephen&#44; coordinator of 3 programs in Durham College&#39;s School of Business&#44; IT &amp; Management&#44; has worked closely with his team to bring fresh layout and equipment changes to the labs they live in for the benefit of their students&#46;
				Labs have been refurbished with new desk layouts and equipment so students have a learning environment that resembles real world&#46;  In addition&#44; relationships with industry partners like Cisco and local industries have introduced new
				and strong contacts and placement opportunities for students approaching their graduation&#46;
				</p>
				<p>Stephen&#39;s current focus is on working with his team to improve their use of <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/" target="_blank">Universal Design for Learning</a> principles in their classes and developing a deeper and more sincere understanding of what authentic teaching and testing is
				and how to better and more consistently implement it in the classroom&#46;  Additionally&#44; he is always exploring and excitedly introducing current technology to his students&#46;
				</p>
				<p>This sight is a testament to Stephen&#39;s passion for teaching&#44; his experience&#44; both in industry and in education&#44; and the philosophy he brings to bare on his teaching and for his students&#46;  Please feel free to stay a while&#44;
